If you are arriving at this page--you have likely come here from Omegahat or the
adjacent site Omegahat.net (the successor to Omegahat.com/R). I do not own either
of those sites---I just need to use the utilities that Duncan Temple Lang has provided.

Unfortunately, we are all very lazy people. No one seems to want to manage these
packages for Duncan, and he (rightfully) has moved on in his career. Alas, while
people continuously post on StackExchange/Overflow bemoaning that the packages
won't compile out of the box after 10 years (!!) on the shelf--no one addresses the problems
in the packages! Someone, no not me, probably should pick up and take over the 
maintenance. Like me, Duncan is probably too busy as he is an Assoc Dean now.
So, we can't blame him. 
But we do love his packages! 

To that end, I have applied a few quick fixes to this package that will now 
allow it to compile from source. And, yes, you will need to do that. From 
what I can tell the other option is a binary file on Omegahat.net which 
is built under an old version of R (R<3.0.0). 

Make sure you have Rcpp updated as well as Rtools40 as 
of the date of this writing (01/09/2022). 

This will provide all the necessary documentation you require below. Note,
the fixes I applied were small---I adjusted the .Rd (rdocumentation) files. 
I make no warrants that the remainder of the code is correct--buyer beware and
all that.

---------------------------------


This provides S-language bindings to read Windows type libraries.  One
can read descriptions of classes, interfaces, enumerations, methods,
etc.  from the libraries as S objects and then use this
meta-information. One application is to automate the generation of S
bindings to the code within the corresponding library.
